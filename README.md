# Verilog_Clock_Frequency_Calculator
Understanding and implementing clock frequency concepts in Verilog HDL. It covers how to calculate clock frequency from time periods,
correctly define clock signals in a testbench, and implement clock division and multiplication techniques in hardware.
The goal is to build a strong foundation in handling clock generation, frequency scaling, and timing analysis in FPGA-based digital designs,
whether the clock frequency is explicitly given or needs to be derived.
