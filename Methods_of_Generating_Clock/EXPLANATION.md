# Methods of Generating Clock :
In Verilog testbenches, generating a clock signal is one of the most fundamental tasks. A clock is created by continuously 
toggling a signal at a fixed time interval, which corresponds to half of the clock period. The delay used for toggling depends 
on the required frequency and the defined timescale.

There are multiple procedural constructs in Verilog that can be used to generate a clock. Each method has its own advantages 
depending on whether you need an infinite clock, a fixed number of cycles, or controlled simulation behavior.
